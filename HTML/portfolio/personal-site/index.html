            The Time Tracker was my senior project during my final semester at Westminster College. My
            goals setting out at the start of my final semester was to create a fantastic desktop experience,
            a JSON mobile API, and a mobile app to interface with the API.

            Speed was key to complete this project. I needed to develop and deploy rapidly considering
            the short time span for this project. These constraints affected the tools I used to build
            The Time Tracker.

            Ruby on Rails is a MVC framework based off of Ruby. I decided early
            on that this would be the basis for the desktop experience and mobile api. While I had no
            Rails experience and minimal Ruby experience going into this project,
            I hoped its similarity to Python would give me a good head start.
            One of the guiding principles in the Rails community is "Convention over Configuration".
            I found this to be both a blessing and a curse. At times I was grateful to
            have Rails handling more of the tasks I didn't feel like dealing with,
            while other times I spent many wasted hours trying to find documentation
            about some small method that it turns out was quite needed.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            For the mobile experience I chose the Ionic Hybrid App Framework.
            Ionic is a package based off of AngularJS, designed exclusively for
            near native mobile apps written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I
            found Ionic was perfect for rapidly writing and deploying my app.
            Since it's foundation is based off of AngularJS, there were plenty
            of guides and tutorials to help me through writing my application.

            In the Spring of 2014 for a Software Engineering class, my classmates Nicole, Charles,
            Anna, and myself were assigned to build a math game for 2nd and 3rd graders. After quickly
            coming up with the name Knack. (Knack Nicole Anna Charles Kyle). We started off.

            When we started designing Knack we had little experience with web development. Nicole
            had quite a bit of HTML and CSS experience. We wanted to do a web framework since they
            are so commonly used in the job market. We decided on Django since Nicole and I had quite a bit
            of Python experience as well.

            Since this was a group project, easy code sharing and  collaboration was crucial.
            We chose to use GitHub for our project. We found that this helped us in more ways than
            just code sharing. It let us add bugs, set tasks, even basic scheduling and releases.

            One of the only downsides to using Python was a performance hit.
            Since Python is an interpreted language, the class in general found it
            to be a bit slower than Java. But once I set up the PyPy interpreter,
            my ray tracer ray about 100x faster. Renders that used to take upwards of 10
            minutes now took only about 10 seconds.

            In a Artificial Intelligence class we built Maze Solvers to demonstrate different search

            This really illustrated how much more effective some algorithms are in solving mazes

            During one of the first classes I took at Westminster, in a group project
            with one other classmate, we were assigned to build a client and server for a
            network protocol the class made. In a class meeting we as a class designed a
            network protocol for an instant messenger. Starting with a web server that we
            had built earlier in the semester, we decide to build a Java based server,
            and a Python based client.

            Once we had finished the project, the client could communicate with the server, and

            really exciting to get together on the last day of class with my other classmates and
            try out our clients together. It was a great example of how a network protocol worked.
